# Next.js Course ‚Äì Learning to Build Fast, Scalable Web Apps

This repository contains my progress and code from a practical course focused on building fast, dynamic, and scalable web applications using **Next.js**, the most popular ReactJS framework for modern projects.

Throughout the course, I‚Äôm learning how to handle **server-side rendering (SSR)**, **static site generation (SSG)**, and optimize web applications for better performance. I'm also exploring how to integrate APIs, handle dynamic routing, and deploy projects to production.

The stack includes **TailwindCSS**, **TypeScript**, and several modern tools that help speed up the development process.
